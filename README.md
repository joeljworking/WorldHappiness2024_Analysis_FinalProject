# WorldHappiness2024_Analysis_FinalProject
A data exploration of what truly drives happiness — GDP or social support — based on the 2024 World Happiness Report. This is for "Python for Public Policy" Final Project

This project analyzes data from the World Happiness Report 2024 to explore whether national happiness is more strongly related to economic prosperity or to social connection. Using Python (pandas and Plotly Express), the analysis compares the correlation between Log GDP per capita, Social Support, and the Ladder Score (happiness) across more than 130 countries.
